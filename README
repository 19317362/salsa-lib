		SALSA-Lib - Small ALSA Library
		==============================

GENERAL
-------

SALSA-Lib is a small, light-weight, hot and spicy version of the ALSA
library, mainly for embedded systems with limited resources.
The library is designed to be source-level compatible with ALSA
library API for limited contents.  Some components like ALSA sequencer
aren't supported, and most of all, the alsa-lib plugins and
configurations are completely dropped.

The current features are like below:

CONFIG
  o No functions snd_config_*() at all.  SALSA-Lib doesn't support
    the configuration files.  (Thus currently alsactl can't be built.)

PCM
  o Supports only the hw layer, i.e. no up/down-mixing, format
    conversion, rate conversion, etc, and no external plug-in
  o Accepts the limited PCM name, "hw", "default", "default:x",
    and "hw:x,y,z"
  o snd_pcm_mmap_read/write*() aren't included
  o No async handler

CONTROL
  o Supports only the hw layer, no plug-in
  o Some H-control functions are not included
  o No async handler

MIXER
  o No sort with weight as default, sorted in the order of numid
  o Simple-none layer only
  o "Capture Source" isn't split to switches but handled as an enum
    (I personally like this better :)
  o dB support can be selected via configure option
  o No linear <-> log dB conversion

TIMER
  o No query interface
  o No async handler

RAWMIDI
  o Almost OK

HWDEP
  o Almost OK

SEQUENCER / INSTRUMENT LAYER
  o Not supported at all yet, no API functions defined
    (alsa-utils/seq/* can't be built)


INSTALLATION
------------

Some configure options are available to reduce the binary size.
The mixer, rawmidi, hwdep and timer components can be stripped via
--disable-mixer, --disable-rawmidi, etc. options.  These componenets
are enabled as default.

The dB range support can be enabled via --enable-tlv option.  It's
disabled as default.

The option --enable-symbolic-functions can be used to enable
symbolic-functions linker option for recent versions of ld.

The library is installed as $LIBDIR/libsalsa.so.*.
This package provides also the compatible alsa.m4 and alsa.pc.  If the
other packages can be autoreconf'ed, you'll be able to link libsalsa
as it is.

Otherwise, if your package needs libasound.so for checking/linking,
simply create a symlink to libsalsa.so:

	# cd /usr/lib
	# ln -s libsalsa.so libasound.so

The C header files are installed into $INCLUDEDIR/alsa.  The
alsa/asoundlib.h should be compatible with the normal alsa-lib's one.
